# GemmyWhy

**GemmyWhy** is the fun, quirky, and slightly sassy clone of Gemini that nobody saw coming but everybody needs. Why? Because it’s not just a clone—it’s a vibe. Think of it as Gemini’s hilarious sibling who isn’t afraid to steal the spotlight and crack a joke while doing it.

## Features
